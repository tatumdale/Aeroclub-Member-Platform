## Herefordshire Aeroclub Member Platform

## Persona 1: Volunteer Member - Experienced Pilot (Primary User)

### Profile
**Name:** John Parker  
**Age:** 56  
**Occupation:** Senior Manager at a manufacturing company  
**Flying Experience:** Private Pilot Licence (PPL), 8 years, ~400 hours total time  
**Membership Duration:** 4 years  
**Flying Frequency:** 2-3 times per month (weather permitting)  
**Aircraft Flown:** PA-28, C172, Rallye  

### Background
John has been a PPL holder for 8 years and is a well-established member of Herefordshire Aeroclub. He learned to fly later in life after his children left home and now treats aviation as his primary hobby. He works full-time as a senior manager, which means he has limited weekday availability but is usually free on weekends and occasionally takes a Friday off for flying.

John is passionate about the club and believes strongly in giving back to the aviation community. He's volunteered informally in the past (covering duty pilot shifts when asked) but finds the current ad-hoc system frustrating - he never knows when help is needed unless someone calls him directly, and he's had to turn down requests when they conflict with his own flying plans.

He's not particularly tech-savvy but is comfortable with basic smartphone and web usage (online banking, email, WhatsApp). He prefers systems that are straightforward and don't require extensive training.

---

### Phase 1 Needs (Volunteer Management)

**Goals:**
- Give back to the club that helped him achieve his PPL
- See when volunteer help is needed without waiting for phone calls
- Book shifts that fit around his flying schedule and work commitments
- Understand what training he needs before volunteering (he's flown for years but hasn't used the till system)
- Get reminders so he doesn't double-book himself

**Pain Points:**
- Only knows help is needed when David calls him directly
- Sometimes has to say no because he's already booked a flight
- Unsure what the duty pilot role actually involves beyond "being there"
- Has forgotten verbal commitments in the past (embarrassing)
- Would help more often if he could see what was needed in advance
- Interested in fire crew but doesn't know if that's even an option

**User Stories:**
- "As an experienced member, I want to see a calendar of volunteer needs so I can plan around my flying"
- "As a volunteer, I want to know exactly what training I need before I commit"
- "As a member, I want automatic reminders because I have a busy schedule"
- "As someone who flies regularly, I want to avoid booking duty pilot on days I'm planning to fly"
- "As a volunteer, I want to indicate interest in Fire Crew so I'm contacted when it launches"

**Success Criteria:**
- Can view volunteer needs and his own flying schedule in one place
- Receives clear confirmation of what he's signed up for
- Gets reminders that don't conflict with flight planning
- Feels his contribution is valued and tracked

### Quotes
> "I want to help out, but I never know when they need people until David rings me - and sometimes I've already booked a flight that day."

> "I've been flying for 8 years, but I wouldn't know where to start with the till system. If they need that, someone needs to show me first."

> "It would be great to just look at a calendar, see what's available, and put myself down. Simple as that."

> "I'd definitely be interested in fire crew stuff - I did fire safety training at work, might as well use it at the club too."

## Persona 2: Volunteer Member - Career Aspirant (Secondary User)

### Profile
**Name:** Sarah Thompson  
**Age:** 26  
**Occupation:** Technical Author for an aerospace company  
**Flying Experience:** Private Pilot Licence (PPL), 1 year, ~100 hours total time  
**Membership Duration:** 3 years (1 year as PPL holder, 2 years as student pilot)  
**Flying Frequency:** 3-4 times per month  
**Aircraft Flown:** C172, PA-28  
**Career Goal:** Professional pilot (airline or corporate)

### Background
Sarah learned to fly at Herefordshire Aeroclub, completing her PPL 12 months ago after 18 months of training. Before that, she joined as a student member and has been part of the club community for 3 years total. The club feels like her second home - she knows all the instructors, many of the members, and genuinely cares about seeing it thrive.

She works full-time as a technical author for an aerospace company (writing maintenance manuals and technical documentation), which gives her some flexibility with working hours and a decent salary to fund her aviation ambitions. She's serious about pursuing an aviation career and is actively building hours and ratings.

With winter approaching and less VFR flying weather, Sarah is planning to use the quieter months productively:
- **Night Rating** (winter is ideal for night flying training)
- **Instrument Rating** (IMC/IR(R) to start, potentially full IR later)
- **Theory exams** (CPL or ATPL ground school - she's researching which path)

She's highly motivated, tech-savvy (works in a technical field), and eager to contribute to the club. Volunteering as a duty pilot would help her stay engaged with the club during periods when she's not flying as much, and she sees it as a way to learn more about airfield operations - valuable knowledge for a career pilot.

- Build a reputation as a committed club member

**Pain Points:**
- Training schedule changes frequently (weather, instructor availability) so hard to commit to fixed volunteer times
- Wants to volunteer but doesn't want it to conflict with surprise good weather days
- Needs flexibility - some weeks she's doing ground school, other weeks she's flying intensively
- Currently no easy way to see volunteer needs that fit her changing schedule
- Would help more if she could book/cancel easily as her training schedule shifts

**User Stories:**

- "As a young member, I want to contribute to the club that gave me my start"
- "As a student with flexible schedule, I want to book shifts at short notice when training gets cancelled"
- "As someone with limited income (funding CPL training), I want to volunteer as my way of giving back"

**Success Criteria:**
- Can book volunteer shifts that work around her unpredictable training schedule
- Can easily cancel if weather turns good and instructor is available
- Feels she's contributing meaningfully to the club
- Learns useful operational knowledge from duty pilot experience

### Quotes
> "I basically live at the club - I want to help out, especially in winter when I'm not flying as much VFR."

> "If I could book duty pilot shifts around my training schedule, I'd do way more. But right now it's too rigid - I might book a slot then get a call from my instructor saying 'weather's good, let's fly'."

> "The club gave me my wings. Now I want to give something back while I'm working toward CPL."

> "Winter is perfect for night rating and instrument training - less competition for aircraft and instructors. I'm going to use this time to build my ratings while everyone else is sitting at home."

## Key Insights for Design

### From John's Persona
1. **Simplicity is critical** - Experienced members may not be tech-savvy
2. **Scheduling conflicts matter** - System must show volunteer shifts and flying in one view
3. **Training transparency** - Make it clear what's required before committing
4. **Recognition matters** - Long-time members want to see their contribution valued
5. **Fire Crew interest** - Safety-conscious members are natural fit

### From Sarah's Persona
1. **Flexibility is essential** - Career-focused members have unpredictable schedules
2. **Career integration** - Volunteering should complement, not compete with training
3. **Modern UX expected** - Young members expect app-quality experiences
4. **Future planning** - Phase 4 (aircraft booking) and Phase 6 (logbook) are critical for her
5. **Community connection** - Volunteering keeps engaged during non-flying periods
6. **Winter opportunity** - Ratings training (night, IR) drives different usage patterns

### Design Implications
- **Conflict detection** is must-have (Phase 4 integration with volunteer shifts)
- **Quick cancellation** with courtesy notice (Sarah's use case)
- **Multiple notification channels** (email for John, mobile for Sarah)
- **Progressive disclosure** (simple for John, power features for Sarah)
- **Long-term roadmap visibility** (Sarah needs to see aircraft booking is coming)

### Scenario 2: Training Coordination
**David needs to train both John and Sarah on new till system**
- David sees John and Sarah both need till training
- Books group training session Friday 5pm (both confirmed available)
- System sends invite to both, they confirm attendance
- After training, David marks both as "Till System: Trained"

### Scenario 3: Emergency Coverage
**Sarah cancels last-minute due to surprise flying opportunity**
- Sarah cancels Wednesday shift (2 days notice)
- System alerts David immediately
- David checks member list, filters by "Available Wednesdays"
- Sees John marked weekends preferred, but tries anyway
- John receives call, can't help (work meeting)
