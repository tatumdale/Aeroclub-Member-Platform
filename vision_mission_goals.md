   - Mobile-friendly access
   - Self-service where possible
   - Clear communication of expectations

2. **Operational Excellence**
   - Reduce manual administrative tasks
   - Eliminate coverage gaps through proactive alerts
   - Enable real-time visibility of operations
   - Support data-driven planning

3. **Sustainable Growth**
   - Build incrementally, validate continuously

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Problem

### Problem Statement

Herefordshire Aeroclub requires volunteer duty pilots to provide coverage when staff take holidays, sickness leave, or general absences. Currently, there is no efficient system for:

- Publishing coverage needs to members
- Allowing members to self-book shifts
- Tracking who is trained and qualified
- Alerting management when coverage gaps exist
- Managing approvals and cancellations

**Result**: Administrative overhead, last-minute scrambling, difficulty tracking contributions.

### Solution

A web-based volunteer scheduling system that enables:
- Public calendar showing duty pilot needs
- Self-service shift booking for members
- Training status tracking and verification
- Automated approval workflows
- Proactive coverage gap alerts
- Operations Manager oversight dashboard

---

## Risks to Mission

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Scope creep in MVP** | Delayed launch, increased costs | Strict feature lockdown, "Phase 2" response to new requests |
| **Low member adoption** | System underutilized, goals unmet | Pre-launch communication, training, incentives |
| **Technical debt accumulation** | Future phases become expensive | Code reviews, refactoring time between phases |
| **Committee wants everything immediately** | Pressure to over-deliver | Show roadmap, demonstrate value of incremental delivery |
| **Firebase costs escalate** | Budget overruns | Monitor usage, set billing alerts, have migration plan |

---

## Conclusion

This is an **ambitious long-term vision with pragmatic near-term execution**. 

- **Vision**: Complete member platform revolutionizing club operations
- **Mission**: Start with volunteer management, validate, then expand
- **Goals**: Measurable success criteria at each phase
